NOTES:
-Recurrent NN are dependent on previous states.
-Genetic Algorithms can be used to find the best models.
-Generative Adversarial Networks probably aren't that helpful ( they can generate things, like pictures)
-One shot learning. Neural Net without much data
-variational autoencoders. Last option. Probably a bit different than needed.
